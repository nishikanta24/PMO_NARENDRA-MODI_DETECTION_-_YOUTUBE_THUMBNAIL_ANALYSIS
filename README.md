**Analyzing political figure usage in Indian educational YouTube thumbnails using ensemble deep learning**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the prevalence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's image in YouTube thumbnails across 5 Indian educational channels (2015-2025). Using an ensemble of deep learning models, we detected Modi in **12,319 out of 84,585 thumbnails (14.56%)** and uncovered a **10.5x surge** in usage from 2019 (2.58%) to 2024 (27.22%).

### Key Question
*Is this algorithmic optimization or coordinated political influence?*

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 📈 Temporal Trends
- **Modi usage exploded:** 2.58% (2019) → 27.22% (2024) - a **10.5x increase**
- **4 out of 5 channels** show statistically significant upward trends (p < 0.05)
- **PathfinderIAS** had the steepest climb: +1.62% per month (r² = 0.79)

### 🗳️ Election Impact
- **2 of 5 channels** (PathfinderIAS, WorldAffairs) showed significant spikes during election periods
- PathfinderIAS: +10.7% during elections | WorldAffairs: +7.3% during elections

### 📊 The "Clickbait Paradox"
- Modi thumbnails get **101% more views** than non-Modi thumbnails
- BUT they have **7.4% lower engagement rate** (likes/views)
- **Conclusion:** Modi = algorithmic bait, not audience satisfaction
